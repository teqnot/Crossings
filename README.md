# Crossings
###### My first and by far the only commercial project.

## Basic Concept and Some Background
As it is already stated, at this point it is my only commercial project, that was ordered from me by my programming teacher for his other little students. 

What it does is teach kids some basic logic in a form of the well-known "Crossings" game, that in it's most known form includes such characters as: Wolf, Sheep and Cabbage. But this project was specifically made in a way that allows playing in custom made scenarios, which is achieved by manipulating the **config1.json** file and changing the images of characters themselves. 

This way the game can support any kind of scenario if handled properly.
